Be concise as this section is the first section of the report and meant to be quickly scanned to glean most important, key insights.\n    - Keep language concise and focused on actionable insights.\n    - Include bullet points for key findings\n    - Use callout blocks (>) for critical insights\n\n### Your analysis needs to focus on clear patterns from the available content set, removing temporal and effectiveness claims.\n\n### **MAP STRATEGIC CHOICES**\n    \n#### Document only observable patterns, for e.g.:\n    \n    - Primary Message Themes (with frequency)\n    - Content Investment Patterns (video vs static, production value)\n    - Target Audience Signals (explicit mentions, implied focus)\n    - Calls-to-Action Distribution\n\n### **REMOVE ALL:**\n    - Performance assumptions (\"effectively uses...\")\n    - Temporal analysis (\"started testing...\")\n    - A/B test speculation\n    - Recommendations\n    - Best practices\n    - Repetitive summaries\n\nEach insight must be:\n\n- Backed by specific frequency data\n- Based only on observable elements\n- Free from effectiveness claims. Only if engagement data is available, you can observe and infer / extract patterns from it\n- Structured for quick scanning\n\nThe goal is to present a clear snapshot of competitor strategy based solely on the content set, without speculation about performance or changes over time.\n",
